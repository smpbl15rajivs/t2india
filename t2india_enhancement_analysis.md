# T2India Enhancement Analysis

## Current State
- T2India homepage is live at https://g8h3ilcvmpw9.manus.space
- Search functionality returns "About 0 results" for complex queries
- Current search box shows the query but doesn't process it intelligently
- Need to implement the "Suggest & Select" interface with radio buttons

## Required Enhancements
1. **Intelligent Query Processing**: Parse complex travel queries and identify components
2. **Ambiguity Detection**: Identify when terms like "spirituality" need clarification
3. **Radio Button Interface**: Present options for ambiguous terms
4. **Dynamic Itinerary Generation**: Create detailed itineraries based on selections
5. **Backend Integration**: Connect to TravMechanix API for intelligent processing

## Implementation Plan
1. Update frontend to show analysis and radio button interface
2. Enhance backend API to detect ambiguity and provide suggestions
3. Implement dynamic itinerary generation with artisan integration
4. Test complete flow and deploy

## Test Query
"12 days travel to india with 2 days in spirituality 5 days in desert palaces 4 days in golden triangle"

Expected behavior:
- Parse: 12 days total, 2 days spirituality, 5 days desert palaces, 4 days golden triangle
- Detect ambiguity: "spirituality" could be Varanasi, Rishikesh, Ajmer, Amritsar
- Show radio button selection interface
- Generate detailed itinerary based on selection
