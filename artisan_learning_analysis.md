# Artisan Learning Query Analysis

## Current System Response
**Query:** "i want to learn miniature painting for 15 days identify where to go whom to meet and average cost of 4 star hotel"

**Result:** "About 0 results for 'i want to learn miniature painting for 15 days identify where to go whom to meet and average cost of 4 star hotel'"

## Problem Identified
The current system does not recognize or handle artisan learning queries. It's treating this as a regular destination search rather than understanding:

1. **Learning Intent** - "want to learn"
2. **Specific Art Form** - "miniature painting" 
3. **Duration Flexibility** - "15 days" (could be 7 days or 1 month)
4. **Artisan Connection** - "whom to meet"
5. **Accommodation Requirement** - "4 star hotel"
6. **Cost Information** - "average cost"

## Required Enhancements

### 1. Artisan Learning Detection
- Keywords: "learn", "workshop", "training", "master", "artisan"
- Art forms: "miniature painting", "pottery", "weaving", "jewelry making"

### 2. Destination Mapping for Art Forms
- **Miniature Painting**: Udaipur, Jaipur, Delhi
- **Blue Pottery**: Jaipur
- **Madhubani Painting**: Bihar
- **Warli Art**: Maharashtra

### 3. Master Artisan Database
- Names and contact details of master artisans
- Specializations and teaching experience
- Workshop availability and pricing

### 4. Accommodation Integration
- 4-star hotels near artisan workshops
- Average daily rates
- Proximity to learning centers

### 5. Duration-based Recommendations
- 7 days: Basic introduction
- 15 days: Intermediate skills
- 1 month: Comprehensive mastery

This is a critical gap that needs immediate attention for the "Artist, Artisans and Authentic Experience" positioning.
